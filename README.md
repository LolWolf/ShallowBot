# ShallowBot

A challenge that was made by some of my friends: to create a chess algorithm (~~within a week~~) to beat each of them. Well, that's pretty much all.

A little late for a week, though, but I'm still working on it, although I haven't quite updated the description. Progress
should be pretty obvious by my commits.
